9781598719505	Praxis: A Brief Rhetoric	Praxis is a brief text, yet it still provides a comprehensive presentation of core rhetorical principles. It informs students of the principles of historical rhetoric, including terms such as ethos, pathos, logos, and kairos, and then applies those concepts to modern issues such as the revolutionary uses of Twitter and climate change. This framework enables students to become critical consumers of the flood of persuasive media that compete for their attention. Moreover, Praxis encourages students to employ this rhetorical framework to the creation of their own texts. Each chapter features readings, activities, and assignments, some serious and thought provoking, while others are creative and fun. The key to this text is flexibility. It can be used as a stand-alone rhetoric with limited readings, or in conjunction with other readers such as the Fountainhead Press V Series. Praxis moves the student from theory to practical reason to action!	{Carol Lea Clark}	44	https://covers.vitalbook.com/vbid/9781680362091/width/200	2020-11-09 22:35:27.986525

9780190070427	Cultures of the West	Cultures of the West: A History, Third Edition, focuses on the ways in which the major ideas and passions of Western culture developed, internally, and how they interacted with the broader world--for good and for ill. The development of such key ideas as religion, science, and philosophy form the central narrative of this book. Cultures of the West stands apart from other textbooks in a variety of ways, the first being thematic unity. What did people think and believe, throughout our history, about human nature, the right way to live, God, the best forms of government, or the meaning of human life? Rather than maintaining a single interpretive stance, author Clifford R. Backman relies upon a consistent set of questions: What did people think and feel throughout the centuries about politics, science, religion, and sex? How did they come to their positions regarding the right way to live? Backman's many years of experience in the classroom have informed his approach--students respond to engaging questions more than they are inspired by facts.	{Clifford R.

The book is distinct from most world history texts in three important ways. First, it explores the ways in which historians use and produce information. Each chapter delves deeply into one or two specific issues of historical inquiry related to the chapter theme, showing how new primary sources, methodologies, or intellectual trends have changed how we engage with the past. Second, it clearly explains the political, economic, and ideological concepts that students need to understand in order to compare events and trends across time and space. Finally, the chapters are organized around global historical themes, which are explored through an array of conceptual and comparative lenses. While the book chapters proceed chronologically, each chapter is written with some chronological overlap linking it to preceding and subsequent chapters. This strategy emphasizes the interconnectedness between the events and themes of one chapter and those of surrounding chapters.	{James Carter, Richard Warren}	24.98	https://covers.vitalbook.com/vbid/9780190901905/width/200	2020-11-09 22:35:27.986525

9780190238711	Perpetua's Journey	Examining issues of power, gender, and religion in the ancient world, Perpetua's Journey: Faith, Gender, and Power in the Roman Empire is a graphic history set in Roman Africa in 203 CE that tells the story of the Christian martyr Perpetua. The Passio Sanctarum Perpetuae et Felicitatis, also known as The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity, is the first extant diary authored by a Christian woman. Vibia Perpetua was a young mother who lived in Roman Africa and, at the age of twenty-two, chose to publicly proclaim her Christian faith. She died as a result of her actions, though she did not die alone; she was part of a group of Christian martyrs, including several slaves, who were placed in prison and then executed in Carthage during the birthday celebrations of Emperor Septimius Severus's son in 203 CE. Perpetua's diary contains her account of the days leading up to her martyrdom. Perpetua's Journey occupies a space between the many works designed primarily for specialists and advanced scholars, who already know a great deal about Perpetua and the history of the Roman Empire, and lives of saints that are intended for general readers. Perpetua's Journey is unique because it combines both sequential art and historical and social commentary, and it places Perpetua's diary in the context of life in Roman North Africa in 203 CE.	{Jennifer A.
